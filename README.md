# Lust in the paintings 

This project was created by [Beatrice Zilli](https://github.com/beatricezilli) and [Antony Persianov](https://github.com/antonpersi) as the final output of the Modelling and Visualizing Textual Data course held at Ca' Foscari Venice University by Professors Tiziana Mancinelli and Antonio Montefusco.

# About the project 

Starting from the course's topic, namely Vices and Virtues, we decided to take into analysis the vice of Lust and investigate its representation in the paintings over the years in the history of art. The project aims at showing how the iconography of Lust changed throughout centuries and how its representation is connected with gender issues, in partiuclar the woman's image. 

The first step was creating a conceptual map on Miro (https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO_zZzUo=/?share_link_id=851890614963), that helped us bearing in mind the path of the project and the structure we wanted it to have. 
After that, we focused on finding the images of the paintings we selected for our project, which had to be in a good resolution and not subjected by copyright. Our lab assitant, [Valerio Remediani](https://github.com/VRemediani), then helped us get the IIIF urls of the images so we could implement the website with OpenSeaDragon and Mirador viewer. 
Once set that steps, we divided the tasks as follow: 
#### Beatrice 
* Website design with html 
* OpenSeaDragon and Mirador 
* Conceptual map on Miro 
* Text descriptions 

#### Anton 
* Manifest 
* Foaf.ttl and RDF 
* Text descriprions 
* Bibliography research 

We then upload everything on GitHub repository as collaborators.
