# Lust in the paintings 

This project was created by [Beatrice Zilli](https://github.com/beatricezilli) and [Antony Persianov](https://github.com/antonpersi) as the final output of the Modelling and Visualizing Textual Data course held at Ca' Foscari Venice University by Professors Tiziana Mancinelli and Antonio Montefusco.

# Our research question

Starting from the course's topic, namely Vices and Virtues, we decided to take into analysis the vice of Lust and investigate its representation in the paintings over the years in the history of art. The project aims at showing how the iconography of Lust changed throughout centuries and how its representation is connected with gender issues, in partiuclar the woman's image. 

Lust is classified by the Christian tradition as one of the seven capital sins. It indicates an excessive, that is irrational, attachment to venereal pleasure. For centuries, the idea of lust has been attributed to the Devil, demons and evil spirits. The representation of this vice has a long history in the art world. In the visual arts, lust has been used as a recurring theme throughout history to represent, and often condemn, the physical and sexual desire. This work focuses, in the first place, on showing how the iconographic representation of lust chnaged over time, but it also investigates the feminine figure in it and how the concept of woman associated to lust shifted throughout centuries.


# Modelling process 
As pointed out by Sahle et al. (2018), the practice of modelling as "explanatory, exploratory and empirical strategies of enquiry" has gain much recognition and attention over the last decades among scientists and scholars, especially with the advent of Digital Humanities that made this practice a core one. Julia Flanders and Fotis Jannidis in their paper (2018) point out the importance od models and modelling in diffierent digital humanities activities, such as creating databases, digital editions, softwares and so on. Modelling is the basic of every digital scholarly project, including this one. 
The first step to answer this research question was creating a [conceptual map](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO_zZzUo=/?share_link_id=851890614963) on Miro, that helped us bearing in mind the path of the project and the structure we wanted it to have. 
After that, we focused on finding the images of the paintings we selected for our project, which had to be in a good resolution and not subjected by copyright. Our lab assitant, [Valerio Remediani](https://github.com/VRemediani), then helped us get the IIIF urls of the images so we could implement the website with OpenSeaDragon and Mirador viewer. 
Once set that steps, we divided the tasks as follow: 
### Beatrice 
* Website design with html 
* OpenSeaDragon and Mirador 
* Conceptual map on Miro 
* Text descriptions 

### Anton 
* Manifest 
* Foaf.ttl and RDF 
* Text descriprions 
* Bibliography research 

We then upload everything on GitHub repository as collaborators. 

# Modelling process
During the process, we used Ontology Foaf to create an RDF triple. The Resource Description Framework is one of the most significant applications of graphs developed by the W3C consortium. With RDF, information about entities is transmitted in a way that is understandable to both humans and machines. This is done through triple, formal statements consisting of a subject, a predicate, and an object.

# Visualization
Our ability to provide a visual representation of our model was made possible by the use of IIIF. The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) standard specifies two APIs that provide access to digital pictures and information. We used the Manifests, a digital display created to facilitate the use and study of lust, to realize our digital project. Additionally, we have a webpage where we experiment with images, different illustration sizes, and illustration details using IIIF, Mirador, and OpenSeaDragon. With the public's assistance, the initiative might be extended further.

# Tool used 

- OpenSeaDragon
- Mirador 
- IIIF 
- Brackets 
- Miro 

# Conclusions 

Lust is such a strong emotion that it has been a mainstay in mythology, religion, and literature. The emotions we feel when looking at these works are often mixed with our own desires for pleasure and power—which may not always align with those of the artist who created them. The goal of this project was to use web technologies such as Mirador Viewer, GitHub repository, IIIF Images, and digital ontologies to visualize a representation of Lust in art. The main idea was to create a creative digital project that stood out from the more formal ones visually appealing. An interactive and unusual depiction of the representation of Lust has been created by combining colors, images of various sizes, brief descriptions, and pills on ideas and concepts. With this project, we hope to encourage the user to explore and think critically about the art in general by posing questions about the vices and virtues. Lust in art can now be experienced not only through paintings or sculptures, but also through web technologies.
